## **Padding, Margin, and Borders** ##

**Padding**

Padding controls the space between content and it's own border, whether the border is visually rendered or not. It is an *internal* space control.

**Margin**

The margin controls the space between the active element (e.g. a div box) and the other elements around it. It is an *external* space control.

**Border**

A border is a line rendered around a piece of content. The border properties controls the components of the 'borderline' itself (e.g. color, thickness). Borders help to visual define the space and organization of an element.

## **Week 12** ##

I was very excited to check the course content this week. Positioning and layout was something I was really confused about. To be fair, I still feel fairly confused, but not as much as I did last week. I tried to do a sort of 'hide-and-seek' interactive with my project this week. Unfortunately, I could only figure out a solution to this design using absolute positioning, which fails if the screen is not big enough. I feel like I challenged my understanding of the content, I'm happy with how it turned out. However, I hope to figure out a solution to this project using a more universal positioning. Getting the background image 'fixed and fullscreen' was also a pain.
