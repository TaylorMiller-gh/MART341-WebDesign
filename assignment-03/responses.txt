**1.** While I can't say I necessarily gain "joy" from these sites, three places I
frequent are [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/dashducks), [Youtube](https://youtu.be/IjMESxJdWkg),
and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com).

**2.** The DNS, or *Domain Name System*, is essentially the phonebook server of IP
addresses. Domain names are coordinated to IP addresses, divided and organized
by a hierarchical system (eg .org, .com, .gov etc)

**3.** A cookie is an identification packet used by servers to track a
user's access on their site. Cookies are exchanged by the web server and the
user's web browser.

**4.** Three essential parts of a URL are the Protocol, the Domain,
and the Path.

**5.**  See README.md

**6.** Things that I have learned, in no particular order,  are as follows:
- How to use *Atom*

- The curious structure of our global cable infrastructure and its resemblance to colonial conquest routes
  - A coincidence, to be sure


- Markdown application and execution
