## **Client Mock Up** ##

The client I had in mind for this project was not imagined - I've been working with a tattoo artist to set up their website. They don't really know much about "tech things," so trying to coordinate what we are doing can be tricky. They basically said they just want a site that is par for the course so to speak. To me, these pages are what that meant. We will probably use Adobe's webpage services or Wix, but this is the lay out that we had agreed on. They're primary concern was the contact page, which needs to funnel people towards a single email.

## **Mobile-First** ##

The majority of internet users are on mobile, and mobile is the most limited device (in terms of size and capability) for using the internet. Designs should center around the most constrained hardware as well as the largest user base. With these users in my mind first, the design should remain consistent regardless of user circumstances - techniques should focus on universal implements rather than 'hard coded' designs.

## **Week 13** ##

This week marked the start of finals for me. The intensity of work increased as did the threshold of my stress levels. It's been difficult, but the skills I've picked up throughout the semester seem to be getting the job done. I've also set aside time in between tasks for "drinking water and doing nothing" to give my brain time to chill out. This tactic hasn't worked yet - it's just been "drinking water and rumination," so I'll have to figure something else out LULW
