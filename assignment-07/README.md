## Internet Forms

Since the internet has become increasingly normalized, I've encountered every technical kind of 'form' one may imagine. Whether I'm filing taxes or ordering pizza, many sites are implementing some kind of data handling/gathering. The most common form is probably a button, but it is surely followed up by email and password input. Having an account on many sites seems to serve no real purpose other than allowing that site have my email and a means for personal data collection.

## Input and its Usage

Probably the best example of a site utilizing text, selection, and button input is *Google*. The text field holds specific string input from the user. Various selection inputs can refine an inquiry. Finally, the submit button engages the entire process. Another incredible example would be a blog-style website like *Facebook*. Users input information into various text fields and post that information using an upload button. The logo at the top of the page serves as an image button.

## My Work Cycle

I continued to use the work cycle I have developed over several weeks:
1. Go through course material.
2. Read assignment and review any necessary concepts.
3. Layout Repository structure.
4. Structure main File elements.
5. Fulfill any writing requirements, images, or links.
6. Review and push to gitHub.
7. Fix errors.

In the future I would like to **push to gitHub sooner and more often** so I may review any errors in the markup language before the entire project has been pushed.
