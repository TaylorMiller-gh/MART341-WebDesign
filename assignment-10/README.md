## **Selector Types** ##

The Universal selector is a "*" and effects the style of all elements.

An Element selector affects the style of the specified Element (eg h1, p, div, etc.)

A class selector creates a style for a designated class. Classes can be attributed to individual elements to apply the selector properties. They are written with a "." (eg .className).

An id selector works the same way a class selector works, but is written with a "#" (eg #idName).

## **Color Palette** ##

The color palette I chose was the retro layout of a Monochrome Terminal: Green (#00ff00) on Black. I also inverted them for the last portion of the site. This design choice is (obviously) to mock a 1980s terminal interface. I was going to go for that weird squiggle and triangle art style that seems prominent in the 80s, but this hacker, cyber-man aesthetic was too good to pass up. I even threw in a bunch of console gibberish and a Star Trek ship to mock the ASCII logos of old terminals.

## **Week 10** ##

I had a lot of fun with the design this week. I don't feel like I really stood a chance with executing some of these design ideas I had though. I couldn't pass up the idea of a typewriter sequence and ended up borrowing some code from a CSS site (which didn't work out great anyway.) Like all other art forms I've engaged in, it's incredibly difficult to translate ideas into reality without years of practice.
