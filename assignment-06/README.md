## Main Document Elements

An html document can only have one head and body element. This is because they are core components to how an html document is processed. The head element is used to contain the processing information and metadata about the document. The body contains the content that will be rendered by the browser.


## Structural v. Semantic

Structural markup gives information about the structure and format of a document, while semantic markup reinforces the meaning and presentation of the information.

## Work Cycle

After going over the lesson, I looked through the assignment to see what I will
be doing in its entirety. If there are any concepts I'm not certain about, I'll
go back to the lesson and review them.

Using GitHub Desktop, I open an editor and structure the directory by creating and naming the files and folders. I then go in to each file and structure the
main elements of the document, followed by structuring the elements of the  content. With all the technical aspects in place, I write whatever needs to be written (with semantics if needed) and substantiate any links or references.
