## **Font Types** ##

**System Fonts**

System fonts are installed on a local device. System fonts are not usually set up for web use as they must be exported as images - very inconvenient.

**Web Fonts**

Web fonts are fonts hosted on the web. These fonts are usually custom-made and optimized for web use. While these designs may be highly optimized, they might not be available to all systems. Therefore, they are not as reliable as web-safe fonts.

**Web-safe Fonts**

Web-safe fonts are fonts that are generally available to all systems. One may expect a users system will have these fonts already.

## **Fallback & Font Stack** ##

A Font Stack is the list of fonts chosen in a font-family by a web developer. The fonts are listed as the preferred choice first followed by the "Fallback" fonts if the user system does not have the primary font. A good fallback font should be as close to the original font as possible. Choosing fonts with major differences in their typography will effect the design and layout of the page.

## **Week 11** ##

This week has been particularly difficult due to a couple extra assignments being thrown into the regular routine. Consequently, I didn't get to spend as much time on this assignment as I wanted to. I had weird problems with coordinating the layout of the webpage because of my poor conceptual approaches. Basically, I didn't think about how the use of page-wide changes would overlap and mess with class specific layouts. I had an image issue and figured "I'll just style a body element and throw the image there." That was a bad decision I think, and I don't believe I really solved this issue. I just tweaked the various attributes of all classes until I got what I was looking for. It was a bit of a nightmare XD! I still have a lot to learn as far as web design goes. I'll try to be more considerate of a holistic design approach in the next assignment.
