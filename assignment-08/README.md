## **Divs, Classes, IDs, and Spans** ##

#### Divs ####

Divs are a *block level element.* They allow developers to group, or block, elements of a page together for the purposes of structural clarity.

#### Classes ####

Classes are attributes given to an element that serve as *identifiers and/or selectors.* While a div is used to create a visual grouping, classes group elements by their internal designation.

#### IDs ####

An id is a *string identifier* specific to an element.

#### Spans ####

Spans are an *inline organizational element.* While a div creates a full-width block, spans occur within divs to group, identify, or style.

## **Video Hosting Services** ##

Video/audio hosting services are ideal for hosting large, high-quality files on a site. HTML allows for easy access and integration when using these services. The downside of these services are browser file compatibility, IP protection, and (in some cases) cost.

## **Week 8** ##

The work throughout my all my classes this week was not as difficult. I went through the lessons without getting too lost or confused, and I managed to complete each assignment in a timely manner. A challenge that did arise this week was stress. My jobs have been fairly demanding the last few days. This, combined with the myriad of normal adult responsibilities proved to be quite stressful. Ultimately, I ended up neglecting my physical and mental wellbeing to accomplish everything, and that's something I'm not okay with. I'm not sure how I'll approach this issue yet, as I don't have many options for recourse. Hopefully Elon Musk will launch Shiba Inu coin to Mars with one of his rockets, and I'll quit one of my jobs.
