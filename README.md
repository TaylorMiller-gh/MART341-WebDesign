# Taylor Miller's MART341-WebDesign
Repository for my Intro to Web Design and Development homework.

Week 2: This week I studied the fundamentals of web development. The material focused on directories and file types with some tasks on gitHub. This isn't my first experience with programming languages; but it's the first time I've used gitHub, so that has been a challenge. Overall, I'm very happy about accomplishing these tasks because technological skills always feel a bit daunting to me.
