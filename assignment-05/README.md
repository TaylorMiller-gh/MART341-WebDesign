# The Wayback Machine #

**1.** I used the Wayback machine to visit facebook.com around 2001, before it became the social media site we know it as. What I found is that the domain used to belong to Atlantic Media. The site, called aboutface, was a commercial electronic-directory meant for people who have "...walked down the hall at your office and greeted a coworker as "hey, there" or "hi, buddy" because you had no idea what their name was." The website had the old, mid-2000's aesthetic: a structural layout lacking any unique graphic design. The site today has had a complete overhaul. However, it still retains the same fundamental function as an electronic directory.
