## **Web Development** ##

At the beginning of this semester I knew next to nothing about Web development. I knew the "inspect element" tab would open nonsense, and not every has mobile-friendly sites. Now I can open the developer tools and inspect the contents of any browser page without getting completely lost - it's still crazy, but I can at least read it.

## **Web Design** ##

I was aware of several concepts in media design that we have talked about such as fonts and color theory. Mobile-design was probably the biggest design-based principle I have learned here. My understanding of typography definitely expanded as well.

## **Week 14 - Final** ##

This mock-up is a fairly straight-forward site. I spent a lot of time trying to get a hamburger menu to replace the nav bar for mobile viewers, but ran out of time (and patience.) I'm a little disappointed I couldn't get that accomplished, but the rest of the site is fairly functional. I look forward to expanding the fundamentals I've gained here in the next Web Dev class.
