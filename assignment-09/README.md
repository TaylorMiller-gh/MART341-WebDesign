## **HTML** ##

Before this class, I knew nothing about html. So, everything has been new so far. Before this week, I was a little unsure about styling divs and utilizing media. The last 9 weeks has been a fair bit of material, but I didn't feel overwhelmed or exceedingly challenged by anything. I'm still having difficulty with translating designs from my mind onto the page - I think this is mostly because I have neither seen all the tools available, nor used them enough to become familiar. I've been spending more time on W3 schools though, and I think I'll get the hang of it.

## **Looking Forward: CSS** ##

I'm really looking forward to learning something of the techniques used to bring websites into the modern era. There is some amazing graphic design happening on the web. People are creating virtual experiences that don't feel like they're part of the web at all - like a small portal into a different dimension. I'm nowhere near being able to do that just yet, but I would certainly like to.

## **Week 9** ##

As previously mentioned, I started spending a bit more time on W3 schools. It's amazing how many tools there are for web development. At the same time, I was surprised how many solutions are found by creating a class rather than utilizing a preprogrammed tag. I suppose javascript and html weren't what I was expecting, but that's a good thing. They still make my imagination turn from what I have seen and that's as much as I could ask for.
Besides challenges with school, I managed to reign in a lot of the stress I had building up from the last few weeks (and years, to be honest). It was really difficult, but I feel like I started taking the steps of clearing a new milestone in life. Change doesn't happen overnight; but I'm fairly certain there's some peace of mind over the next horizon, and I can weather another year knowing that's what I'm walking towards.
